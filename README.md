## Decision making documentation App
Application for documenting decision making process for Digital Heritage domain. 

The app is using data from the STARC data repository and potentially external data to enable heritage proffesionals document their work procedures. The idea is that users should be able to build a data structure that describes their cognitive processes when involved in various steps of data processing. 

The technology behind the app is based on Angular.js, Foundation, and JS Plumb. 

Users can explore existing decision processes or can decide to create the new one. The process of documentation involves adding the nodes to the decision tree, adding data and description to the nodes, and of establishing the connections between nodes. The connections also are described using text, external links, or by attaching digital objects to it. Each node and a connection can be seen as an interactive data collections used to describe a single step in the process. Connections are also assigned the confidence measure that describes the level of confidence users are having in each step. Finally the result is an interactive decision tree that holds information about individual processing steps, or are used to state some idea. The tree also can serve as an entry point for exploring data collections of the repository.
